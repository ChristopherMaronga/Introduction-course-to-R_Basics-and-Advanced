# Introduction-course-to-R_Basics-and-Advanced
Welcome everyone to this repo. The purpose of this platform is for sharing Knowledge with my friends who are interested in Learning R

## About
This is a small project for all my friends (new and existing) where we are trying to enhance R skills on each other. Its a slow learning curve for all participants and the course does not have a set date for completion, however there will be assesments after every class/interactive session

I am hoping to get more friends join me as we explore this wonderfull language. 
If you are interested to join, kindly contact me via skype at skype Id `christopher.sianyo`. Classes will be done via skype and/or google video conferencing whichever will be convinient for us.

I aim to teach in a structured way(start from basics/base R) to more advanced skills available today for doing different stuff in R such as `R-markdown` for reproducible research/ conference presentations and interactive dashboards using `Shiny`

# Timelines and schedule
The course will start on `05-Feb-20118` and will through for approximately 6 weeks. Target is to have 2 classes every week, every Tuesday(review previous given home assignment) and every Friday(going through new materials)
