## Introduction
By the end of this session, you will be able to do the following :-

- Understand types of R objects available
- learn  to construct different types R objects
- Work with objects by performing various operations on them
- Understand objects metadata and how to list them in the command line

You will get to learn various data structures/objects classification.

  - Homogeneous/heterogeneous (based on their contents)
  - one dimension(1d), two dimensional(2d) and n dimensional (nd)

##  Types of R objects
There are 5 **MAJOR** types of objects that you will encounter while working with R.
They include :- 

  - Vectors
  - Matrices
  - Arrays
  - Lists (_special type of vectors_)
  - Data frames
  
Note that **all** other types of R objects you will encounter in future are built and originate  from the above five types.

This session will cover a hands - on introduction to these objects, how to create and work with them. Given an R object, use `str()` to determine what data structure/type it's composed of.
