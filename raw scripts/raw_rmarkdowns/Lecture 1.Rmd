## What is **R**?

- Software environment for data analysis, statistical computing, and graphics
- Statistical Programming language with a natural ease of use. Permits creating simple and complex functions/programs to execute various tasks

Beyond the scope, there is a lot more things you can do with R.

R originated from the statistical programming language S which was developed by John Chambers in the 1970’s

The 1st ever R version was developed by Robert Gentlemen and Rose Ihaka at the university of Auckland in the 1990’s

## Why should I learn **R**?
```{r why R, out.width="100%",fig.align='center',out.height="80%"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/why_R.png")
```
